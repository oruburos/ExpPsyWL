# `angular-seed` â€” the  for AngularJS apps



## Getting Started

To get you started you can simply clone the `angular-seed` repository and install the dependencies:



### Install Dependencies

We have two kinds of dependencies in this project: tools and AngularJS framework code. The tools
help us manage and test the application.

* We get the tools we depend upon and the AngularJS code via `npm`, the [Node package manager][npm].
* In order to run the end-to-end tests, you will also need to have the
  [Java Development Kit (JDK)][jdk] installed on your machine. Check out the section on
  [end-to-end testing](#e2e-testing) for more info.

We have preconfigured `npm` to automatically copy the downloaded AngularJS files to `app/lib` so we
can simply do:

```
npm install
```

Behind the scenes this will also call `npm run copy-libs`, which copies the AngularJS files and
other front end dependencies. After that, you should find out that you have two new directories in
your project.

* `node_modules` - contains the npm packages for the tools we need
* `app/lib` - contains the AngularJS framework files and other front end dependencies

*Note copying the AngularJS files from `node_modules` to `app/lib` makes it easier to serve the
files by a web server.*

### Run the Application

We have preconfigured the project with a simple development web server. The simplest way to start
this server is:

```
npm start
```

Now browse to the app at [`localhost:8000/index.html`][local-app-url].


## Directory Layout

```
app/                  --> all of the source files for the application
  app.css               --> default stylesheet
  core/                 --> all app specific modules
    version/              --> version related components
      version.js                 --> version module declaration and basic "version" value service
      version_test.js            --> "version" value service tests
      version-directive.js       --> custom directive that returns the current app version
      version-directive_test.js  --> version directive tests
      interpolate-filter.js      --> custom interpolation filter
      interpolate-filter_test.js --> interpolate filter tests
  view1/                --> the view1 view template and logic
    view1.html            --> the partial template
    view1.js              --> the controller logic
    view1_test.js         --> tests of the controller
  view2/                --> the view2 view template and logic
    view2.html            --> the partial template
    view2.js              --> the controller logic
    view2_test.js         --> tests of the controller
  app.js                --> main application module
  index.html            --> app layout file (the main html template file of the app)
  index-async.html      --> just like index.html, but loads js files asynchronously
e2e-tests/            --> end-to-end tests
  protractor-conf.js    --> Protractor config file
  scenarios.js          --> end-to-end scenarios to be run by Protractor
karma.conf.js         --> config file for running unit tests with Karma
package.json          --> Node.js specific metadata, including development tools dependencies
package-lock.json     --> Npm specific metadata, including versions of installed development tools dependencies
```




**Note:**
Under the hood, Protractor uses the [Selenium Standalone Server][selenium], which in turn requires
the [Java Development Kit (JDK)][jdk] to be installed on your local machine. Check this by running
`java -version` from the command line.

If JDK is not already installed, you can download it [here][jdk-download].
